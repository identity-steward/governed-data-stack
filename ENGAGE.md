# Engagement

This repository is designed to be self-operable.

Most readers will never need to initiate contact.
Those who do usually know why.

This file exists to clarify **when engagement makes sense**
and **how to proceed without friction or pressure**.

---

## When Engagement Is Appropriate

Engagement is appropriate if you:

- align with the local-first, edge-authority approach
- understand the importance of exit readiness
- are managing data or media that has long-term value
- are introducing automation or agents into your workflows
- prefer delegation over ongoing self-maintenance
- want governance without platform dependency

Engagement is **not** required to use or fork this repository.

---

## What Engagement Is (and Is Not)

Engagement is:
- exploratory
- scoped
- reversible
- non-exclusive

Engagement is **not**:
- a sales call
- a support ticket
- an obligation
- a transfer of authority

If delegation occurs, it does so under explicit scope
with revocation preserved.

---

## How to Initiate

If you believe engagement is appropriate:

Prepare a brief note including:
- a short description of your context
- the scale and type of data involved
- whether automation or agents are present or planned
- what prompted you to reach out

You do **not** need to provide sensitive details at this stage.

---

## Contact Method

Initiate engagement by opening a **private conversation**
through the appropriate channel linked from this repository
or affiliated organization.

If you arrived here through GitHub,
an issue or discussion may be used *only* to request contact,
not to disclose details publicly.

---

## Response Expectations

- Engagement is selective by design
- Not all requests will proceed
- A lack of response should be interpreted as
  misalignment, not rejection

This protects both parties.

---

## Framing Note

Delegation is a matter of trust.
Trust begins with alignment.
Alignment begins with clarity.

If this repository resonates,
you already understand the work.
