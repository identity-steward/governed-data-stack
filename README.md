# Governed Data Stack

**Local-first data governance for environments defined by reuse, automation, and scale.**

This repository documents a practical architecture for retaining **custody, provenance,
and exit power** over data and media while participating fully in modern platforms,
cloud services, and AI-driven systems.

Forking is expected.  
Reuse is anticipated.  
Governance travels with the work.

## Problem Statement

Most consumer and enterprise cloud systems optimize for:
- convenience
- retention
- platform lock-in

They do **not** optimize for:
- long-term custody
- provenance continuity
- cost containment
- exit readiness
- delegated automation under user control

As a result, data quietly accumulates in environments where:
- authority is unclear
- costs compound
- reuse becomes extractive
- users cannot easily leave

This stack addresses those failures **without rejecting modern tooling**.

## Design Principles

This architecture is built on the following constraints:

- **Local-first authority**  
  Canonical data, keys, and policy live at the edge.

- **Fork-friendly participation**  
  Reuse is allowed; silent extraction is not assumed.

- **Governed use, not restriction**  
  Participation is signaled through provenance and policy, not takedowns.

- **Exit as a primary requirement**  
  Any component must be replaceable without re-architecture.

- **Delegation with revocation**  
  Automation and agents operate under explicit, revocable scope.

## What This Repository Contains

- **Architecture documentation**  
  How to structure data across edge, cloud, and archive tiers.

- **Cost and dependency analysis**  
  Where cloud costs grow and how to arrest them.

- **Operational examples**  
  Redacted walkthroughs demonstrating real-world application.

- **Delegation pathways**  
  How this stack may be operated by an agent when self-maintenance is undesirable.

This is a **reference implementation**, not a framework mandate.

## Who This Is For

This repository is written for people who:
- already think in systems
- value local control
- understand forks, versions, and exit
- want to participate in AI-era tooling without surrendering authority

It is not written for:
- passive consumption
- platform dependency
- closed ecosystems
